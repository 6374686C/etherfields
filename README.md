# 🌌 Etherfields

**Etherfields** is a small web experiment about atmosphere and mood.  
It lets you shape endless ambient worlds — mixing drones, nature, and subtle textures until it feels right.

🎧 **Features**
- Three core themes: *Dark Drone*, *Floating*, and *Focus Meditation*  
- Natural layers like rain, thunder, forest, campfire, and ocean  
- Spatial **3D binaural sound** that gives every tone its own space and depth  
- Smooth real-time volume control and fading between layers  
- Remembers your mix when you come back  
- A **Realmcraft** mode where you can build your own world from silence  

🪐 **Experience**
Etherfields isn’t a playlist — it’s a space.  
Something to have open while you work, think, or drift off.  
The sound slowly moves around you, changing just enough to stay alive.

🎧 **Headphones recommended.**  
They reveal the small shifts in space and the movement between layers.
